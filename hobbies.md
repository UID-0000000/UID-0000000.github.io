# Hobbies

## noting





## Swimming & Surfing

<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

This is my love. Her name is Qbo (QÂÆù).
